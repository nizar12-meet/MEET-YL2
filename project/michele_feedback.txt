I like the app - the design is a bit loud and I’m not sure quite where to look at at first, but I very clearly understand where I am supposed to enter my time and how. I like the helper text that you included. The other thing I like is that you included the time that is NOW, so that I know what the app is thinking. The problem is that I can’t seem to press the SniZZZ button (even though you tell me to). When I press it, nothing happens. I don’t know if I pressed it or if anything is working, but to the user it looks like it doesn’t work. The code for the alarm clock looks right, but I can never seem to get the alarm to go off. From your blocks editor, I think what happened is that the SniZZZ button started off disabled, for some reason. Either way, because of this I can’t set an alarm and have it go off. If the SniZZZ button is supposed to be pressed when the alarm goes off, that should be made clear in the helper text at the bottom of the app. I think this fix is fairly simple, if you want to continue to make it perfect. Good job with the rest of the app, and congratulations for persisting through the countless problems you had with the code throughout this process.
