an alarm clock (based on knowing the time for now and comparing it to what the user chose), you can also add a description.... So if u click the "SniZZZ" button it gives you an equation and if you solve it wrong it shoes you a pic to try again... If right the sound stops, a pic with "good morning" appears and the description becomes red and bigger... 

I know it's not a really smart thing to do, but I'm going to tell you I wanted to do more, but couldn't for the lack of time, and because I can't work on it at home... 
1)) to only let you press the button when the sound goes on (I could've done it by making it invisible until the sound goes on)................
2)) To make It give you different equations all the time ( I could've done it by defining two variables that give you  random numbers and then check how much is X*Y)................. 
3)) To make the sound ring only one time and to ring ALWAYS until sth stops it... as it rings a little at every second.. until "time" does not equal "alarm".. that would remove the little sound after every second after the problem is solved.. and that would also allow me to add Seconds to the alarm...
4)) I wanted to also add days and years... It's soo easy but I didn't think of it before..
5)) To make the background color of the description green, hahaha..
